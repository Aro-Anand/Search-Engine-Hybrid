    "title": "Apollo Clinic Franchise for Diagnostics",
    "sector": "Health & Fitness",
    "description": "Highlights Apollo Clinic franchise could be a great opportunity for you to be a part of a bold and historic chapter in Indian healthcare. As you will realize, the project is an extremely attractive investment proposition. Apollo Clinic will have consultation services like General Medicine, Gynaecology, Paediatrics and Cardiology through a team of full-time physicians and visiting consultants available for General Surgery, Dentistry, Gastroenterology, Urology, Dermatology, and Orthopedics along with counselling services in areas like Diet and Nutrition along with Hospital Information Centre and lab being operated by AHLL Apollo clinic franchise cost Each Apollo Clinic franchise has an area requirement of 4000 sq. ft. carpet space and a Project Cost of Rs 2.5 - 2.75 Cr. The Project cost includes investment in Medical Equipment, Interiors and Furniture, Civil Modification, Air Conditioning, Electrical , Information technology (Hardware and Software), Lease Deposit ( if the premises are taken on rent), Preliminary and Pre-operative expenses, Working Capital Margin, Contingency Funds and License Fees to Apollo. The project is ideally funded on a 1:1 Debt Equity ratio. The debt has been taken for a period of Four years with a one-year moratorium on principal payment. Adequate amounts have been budgeted for infusion of fresh capital into the project over a period of Five years, for which duration the projections have been made. Apollo Health and Lifestyle has also tied up with State Bank of India (rate of interest 12%-15%) for project funding. Q. What are the revenue streams in a Clinic? And what is the overall profitability? The Clinic will derive its income broadly from the following services: Consultation including counseling services Diagnostic Services Preventive Health Check Programs Dental Services Treatment room Others (Telemedicine, doctor @home, referrals etc) The Apollo Clinic franchise is expected to generate revenue through all of the above sources. It is also expected that there will be a large degree of cross-referrals between various revenue generating streams. In the first year of operation, the Clinic in India can expect to generate between Rs. 15 million to Rs. 20 million, depending upon the facilities that are provided. Q. What does Apollo Health and Lifestyle Limited charge as fees? AHLL charges an 'Initial License Fee' at the time of signing the Agreement . This license is valid for a period of Five (5) years, which is the tenure of the License Agreement. As royalty fee, AHLL will charge a percentage of the gross turnover of the clinic , which will be payable on a monthly basis. Q. Will AHLL or AHEL make investment (even a token amount) in these Clinics? Since the chain of Apollo Clinic is being set up on a franchise basis, the franchisee will be responsible for the entire investment. Where requested, AHLL will assist the franchisee in arranging term loan from a bank. However, neither AHEL nor AHLL will not make any investment in the clinic. It will also not give any guarantee to the lender. Q. What will be the relationship between existing Apollo hospitals, Apollo Clinic? While every Apollo Clinic will be an independent entity, both the entities will benefit from the common brand building and similar exercises. Also, the Clinic can benefit from being able to refer customers for high end diagnostics as well as tertiary or in-patient care to the Apollo Hospitals. At the same time, the Clinic will gain from referral income while retaining the customer. The goodwill of all these facilities shall automatically come to you through Apollo brand name. Specific association with any or all of these entities, shall be based on local market conditions and business needs. Q. If an Apollo clinic is set up in a city where a full-fledged Apollo hospital already exists, will it not mean unnecessary competition within the same organization? Apollo Clinic shall focus on primary healthcare . We do not perceive any competition from the existing Apollo facilities which are mostly secondary and tertiary care facilities. Secondly, no two Apollo facilities would be operating in the same territory as any other Apollo facility. In fact, such facilities would create synergy in terms of referrals. Q. What will be the name of the Clinic? Can the name be altered or modified? Every clinic will be called \" Apollo Clinic \". No deviations are allowed. The name and signage has been standardized and no deviation, beyond AHLL's stated guidelines, will be permissible. Q. What is the growth plan for the Clinic? Can I ever own an Apollo franchised hospital? Currently our focus is on primary healthcare as it is an area with tremendous unexplored and unutilized potential. The growth of clinics is envisaged in terms of geographical expansion or/ and sub-franchising as also through introduction of additional facilities like CT Scan, dentistry etc. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of setting up hospitals at a later stage with the Apollo Group. Q. How are the physicians going to be associated with the Clinic? The Apollo Clinic franchise will have a Consultant General Medicine, Pediatrician, Gynecologist and a Cardiologist. These physicians will form the core team, but besides the Consultant General Medicine, all other specialty doctor will not normally be on the full time rolls of the Clinic. Apart from them, the Clinic will have a group of visiting consultants from various disciplines like General Surgery, Orthopedics, Endocrinology, Urology etc. The Clinic will also have a Radiologist and a Pathologist on its full time roll. The hours of employment may however be decided based on the local conditions. The Consultant General Medicine will take care of the preventive Health Checks programs too. All other doctors will be consultants. Q. How would doctors and technical staff be recruited? What will be AHLL role in Apollo clinic franchise? The method of employment of doctors would vary from city to city. AHLL will assess the financial implications on the business and recommend full time employment, revenue sharing based association or any other method that is considered appropriate. Good technical staff is adequately available in the market. AHLL shall help in recruiting such all key staff by designing advertisements, conducting interviews, and short listing. Q. What would be the profile of a typical Clinic Manager? The professional manager should preferably be an MHA with excellent managerial skills, marketing acumen and a flair for customer relationship management. He would have about 7-8 years of work experience, preferably in a primary healthcare facility. Doctors in administration may also fit the profile. Q. How many people do I need to employ to run the Apollo Clinic franchise operations? Typically staffing requirements in India vary between 20 to 25. Actual staffing could vary depending on a number of variables including the number of facilities set up and the number of floors occupied by the Clinic. Q. Are the locations for opening an Apollo clinic restricted? Can the clinics be set up anywhere in India or abroad? AHLL has prioritized certain cities based on Market Surveys conducted for the establishment of new clinics. Some of these cities are being considered for implementation in the first phase itself. Other cities shall be covered in the second and third phase. Q. What are preventive health-checks and how important are they? Preventive health-checks are checks performed on individuals to determine the stat of their health by carrying out a series of diagnostic tests. Preventive healthcare is catching up in bigger towns and cities. There is already a lot of corporate business in this area. We intend to popularize the maxim of \"Prevention is better than cure\" through our marketing programs. Very soon, with the entry of private insurance companies, preventive health checks will become a norm. Insurance companies would certainly prefer paying for pre-insurance health checks than settling large hospitalization bills. Secondly, while allotting an insurance policy to anybody, insurance companies would rather have an institution like Apollo certifying the health of a prospective customer as against an individual.",

Retail pharmacy is similar to a trading business Operations primarily consist of sourcing the required medicines and other general products from many suppliers and selling them to the end customers through the retail counter To be able to do this successfully, a pharmacy should be well versed in these: Identifying and estimating the demand for the products in the area Maintaining stock levels and ensuring availability of the products at MedPlus Franchise Minimizing stock loss due to expiry, damage, theft or pilferage Identifying multiple suppliers for all the products Negotiating prices, discounts and payment terms with the suppliers Procuring in time and as per need Maintaining necessary registrations, documentation and procedures to comply with the laws of the state and drug regulatory authorities Maintaining a record of customer details, sales data and stock outs Continuous updating of stock based on knowledge acquired over time Managing the staff members involved in the pharmacy operations Managing cash with an understanding of costs, revenue, profit and loss Satisfying customers with great service Generating demand by marketing and promotional schemes Why MedPlus Franchise?

As a MedPlus Franchisee, you are at an unparalleled advantage to address these challenges encountered in operating a pharmacy Challenge 1: Sourcing a high number of SKUs(Products) from a highly fragmented market To manage hundreds and thousands of brands and products in terms of sourcing, stocking and payments while managing sales & staff. Advantage@ MedPlus Franchise; Our proven process handles this just at the click of a button. All you need to do is to concentrate on counter sales, staff management, and customer relations Challenge 2: Proper inventory planning A pharmacy is only successful if it is able to make all requested products available. However, poor inventory planning leads to lack of capital and losses due to unsold and expired stock. Advantage @ MedPlus Franchise; Inventory management and ordering as per local demand is completely automated to avoid additional capital investment needs and minimize losses. Read about Retail Franchise Challenge 3: Low quality and fake medicines Due to a fragmented and unregulated supply chain, low grade, poor quality medicines are easily available in the market. Protection from them needs investment in process, time and experience Advantage @ MedPlus Franchise MedPlus minimizes this by sourcing all products directly from manufacturers and its direct authorized distributors only The stocks are then meticulously maintained in proper storage conditions during warehousing and transportation to the pharmacies Challenge 4: Competition Pharmacy business is a relatively low-risk business with a good return on investment, hence competition is high Advantage @ MedPlus Franchise; Brand recognition and attractive discount and loyalty schemes attract a high number of customers to the store and retain the customers. An independent pharmacy will never be able to offer 20% to 30% savings on medicines that a MedPlus store offers. Challenge 5: Profitability and Gross Margins The trade margins for many of the products sold in a pharmacy are low and fixed. To address this, an independent pharmacy has to source less priced private label products with the best quality which can happen only if volumes are good and have a domain expertise in sourcing.\r\nAdvantage @ MedPlus Franchise; MedPlus, due to its huge scale is able to offer a wide range of high-quality private label products both in medical and general segments with a higher margin. Challenge 6: Online pharmacies Online retail is growing by significant leaps and bounds in India and it is just a matter of time before e-pharmacies will become an established feature of the competitive landscape. This is definitely a threat to an independent pharmacy. Advantage @ MedPlus Franchise; We are an omnichannel retailer. MedPlus Franchise can service both online and offline customers in that area. Challenge 7: IT systems & Technology Support To do well, pharmacies need easy to operate, tamper-proof, transparent MIS technology and billing systems which are often expensive to procure and difficult to use Advantage @ MedPlus Franchise; We provide all the systems needed by the franchise and technology support which enables you to handle the pharmacy â€“ sales, purchases, customer records, bank deposits without any hassle. To reduce billing time we are the first ones in pharmacy business to introduce bar-coded products. Challenge 8: Additional sources of revenue For marketing their products, medical and FMCG brands engage pharmacies to preferentially display their products or to advertise their services to the walk-in customers. Additional revenue benefit will be very minimal as an independent pharmacy. Advantage @ MedPlus Franchise; Due to our reach and better-negotiating capacity, the ability to earn a better income is more through this channel. This is a shared income between the franchise and MedPlus. Challenge 9: Investment capital To start an Independent Pharmacy of a similar standard to a MedPlus store, a capital investment of Rs. 18 - 20 lakhs is needed, plus an additional investment towards working capital to fund non-moving inventory and initial operating losses. Advantage @ MedPlus Franchise; You will be able to start with a self-investment of 6-8 lakhs, and obtain the rest of the capital in the form of a loan through the financial assistance scheme in place with SBI exclusively for MedPlus Franchisees. What support does MedPlus provide to the franchise? Assistance with selecting the right location for the store Help with store identification and lease finalization Complete layout plan, branding materials and furniture and systems required Training for the franchise and its staff Facilitate a bank loan if required Supply all products sold through the store Operational support through the running of the store Audit support What is the eligibility criteria to be a franchise or who can become a franchise? Basic Profile: Individuals willing to work hard, diligent and dedicated Should be willing to personally manage the pharmacy operations rather than through employees Should have the ability to do basic mathematics and understand trade terms, margins, profit & loss Education & Experience: A pharmacist qualification is helpful, however, it is not mandatory At a minimum, a candidate should have completed SSC or Intermediate level education Prior experience in a pharmacy or managing a small business will be favourable Investment Capacity: Ability to invest about Rs 6 to 7 lakhs and own a collateral property worth at least Rs 6 lakhs to receive a loan under the special scheme towards remaining investment In what locations are the franchises offered? MedPlus Franchises will become available across India. Location & Premises Criteria: Any town with more than 50,000 population would be suitable for a Medplus Pharmacy A minimum of 300 Sft or more in the main market area with good frontage and unrestricted access to the premises What are the investment details for a franchise store? Total investment required to set up a MedPlus Franchise is between Rs 17.50 to 20 lakhs depending on the location and the size and condition of the premises. This amount covers franchise fee, refundable security deposit to premises owner (rental advance), interiors, storage racks, furniture, computer systems and printer, branded stationery and initial inventory (stocks). Of this amount, the franchise should be able to invest Rs 6-7 lakhs of his own and would be able to obtain the balance as a loan under a special scheme through State Bank of India across India, subject to having a collateral of around 6 lakhs.",

    "title": "Why is PCD Pharma Franchise a good option for business startup?",
    "sector": "Services",
    "description": "PCD Pharma franchise offers an opportunity for startups to enter the Pharmaceutical industry with reduced risk, access to an established brand, and the support of an experienced parent company. However, like any business venture, it's crucial for startups to conduct thorough research, evaluate the market potential, and negotiate favorable terms in the franchise agreement for long-term success. Here are some reasons why PCD Pharma Franchise is considered a good option for business startup: 1). Low Investment: Starting a pharma business from scratch involves significant investment in manufacturing facilities, regulatory compliance, and establishing a distribution network. PCD pharma franchise, on the other hand, requires a relatively lower investment as most of the infrastructure and products are provided by the parent company. 2). Reduced Risk: Joining a reputed PCD pharma franchise company reduces some of the risks associated with starting a new business. Franchisees can rely on the experience and support of the parent company, which helps mitigate potential challenges. 3). Established Brand Associating with an established PCD pharma franchise company allows startup businesses to benefit from the brand's existing reputation and goodwill in the market. An established brand can build trust among healthcare professionals and customers more quickly. 4). Product Portfolio:: PCD Pharma franchises typically offer a diverse product portfolio, including both generic and branded medicines. Having a range of products can help startup businesses cater to various healthcare needs and target a broader customer base. 5). Marketing and Promotional Support: Franchise companies often provide marketing and promotional support to their franchise partners. This support can include marketing materials, visual aids, product samples, and other promotional tools, which can be crucial for startups to promote their products effectively. 6). Licensing and Legal Compliance: There might be costs associated with obtaining necessary licenses and permits to operate a pharmaceutical distribution business legally. 7). Access to Established Distribution Network: The franchise company already has an established distribution network, which can be advantageous for startups. It ensures a smoother supply chain and quicker access to the market. 8). Profit Potential: A successful PCD pharma franchise can be a lucrative business venture. While the profit margin can vary, efficient marketing strategies and higher sales volumes can lead to a reasonable profit. 9). Focus on Sales and Marketing: PCD pharma franchise allows startups with a sales and marketing background to focus on their strengths while leaving the manufacturing and quality control aspects to the parent company.",
